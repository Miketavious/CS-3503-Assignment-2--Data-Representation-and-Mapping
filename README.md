# CS 3503 Assignment 1- Number Base Conversion

## Author

## Description
Advanced data representation functions for Owl Tech’s CPU design team.

## What’s New
- Direct mapping functions (oct/hex/bin)
- Signed number representations
- Reused test framework from A1
## Build Instructions
‘‘‘bash gcc-o convert convert.c main.c ./convert ‘‘‘

## Test Results
51/51 tests passed

## Notes
My second C code. Much of the logic was easy to follow,
though oct_to_hex turned out to be a lot more in depth
despite being able to use the oct_to_bin code. 
Fortunately, this time there were no problems in main.c. 
All it took was a few changes from A1's main for the different
input variables.
